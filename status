implemented support for automated Windows AWS WorkSpaces home directory migration using AWS Lambda and SSM.

Key highlights of this update:

Migration supports 1:1 and 1:many scenarios between source and destination directories.
Users can be migrated individually or in bulk using a configurable environment variable.
The migration process ensures:
Seamless zipping and upload of D:\Users directory from the source
Backup stored securely in an S3 bucket (windows-workspace-migration)
Unzipping and safe overwrite on the destination WorkSpace without data loss
